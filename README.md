# settleup-stripe
 
 
This is the open-source version of the integration that you can find in [our website](https://stripe-settleup.web.app).


On the website, you can quickly connect your Stripe and Settle Up account and it's done.

To install this version, you have to deploy it as a Firebase Cloud Function (or any server that you own), set the config variables to yours, create a bot account that adds the transactions, and add that bot account to your group through the Settle Up app (or the sandbox version if you are testing).

Refer to [Settle Up's API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mxnyYSm39cbceA2FxFLiOfyyanaBY6ogG7oscgghxU/edit?usp=sharing) and [Stripe's API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/) for more information
